 <legend>How it Works</legend>
Mt Gox allows you to trade US Dollars (USD) for Bitcoins (BTC) or Bitcoins for US Dollars.<p>
You are trading with other users of Mt Gox. Mt Gox does not act as a counter party to any trades.<p>
The price you buy or sell bitcoins for is up to you. If there is no one that will currently accept your offer then your offer will be saved and the trade will happen once someone comes along and accepts your offer.<p>

 <legend>Trade Example</legend>
Mt Gox will try to fill as much of your order as possible when you enter it. For example suppose you want to buy 20 BTC. Let's say 2 users have entered 2 offers to sell BTC. User A is selling 3 BTC for $.02. User B is selling 40 BTC for $.04.
So you see that the lowest price right now is $.02. But when you enter your buy order for 20 BTC at $.02 you end up buying the 3 BTC from User A and and outstanding offer for buying 17 BTC at $.02.
</p>
<p>
Now suppose you really want those 20 BTC now and you would pay up to $.08 for them. Instead of buying 20 at $.02. You could just enter 20 at $.08. You will buy the lowest outstanding offers first. So you would end buying 3 BTC from User A at $.02 and 17 BTC from User B at $.04. And then your order is filled.

 <legend>How we keep the Server up</legend>
We make money by keeping a 1% spread for the buyer and seller. But the price you buy or sell at is the price you get.<p>
The way it works is if you enter a sell price of X the buyer sees the price as X*1.02.  
So your trades will complete at the price you see on your order the other guy will just be agreeing to a slightly different price.
