 <legend>Advanced Callback Setup</legend>
 
This is a fully automated process where you are notified any time a user successfully sends you payment. 
This method requires you to set up a call back url that we hit to notify you there has been a transaction.
<p>
Here is how the flow works:
<ul>
	<li>User on your site is clicks a checkout button.</li>
	<li>User is taken to our checkout page where he can confirm the transaction.</li>
	<li>User is returned to your site.</li>
	<li>Mt Gox posts to your confirmation URL telling you the transaction was completed.</li>
	<li>(optional) For extra security your confirmation page can post back Mt Gox to make sure the confirmation post was from us.</li>
	<li>You have been paid and it is safe to ship the User whatever you are selling.</li>
</ul>
